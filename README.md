# Library Manager
You've been tasked with creating a library management system for a small library. The librarian has been using a simple sqlite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to handle the library's books, patrons and loans.

You'll be given static HTML designs, a set of requirements and the existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

## Requirements
### Models
- [x] The library.db file should contain 3 tables. Create a Sequelize model for a books table, a patrons table, and a loans table. There are no timestamps.
  - [x] The books table should have the following columns: id an integer, title a string, author a string, genre a string and first_published an integer.
  - [x] The patrons table should have the following columns: id an integer, first_name (string), last_name (string), address (string), email (string), library_id (string) and zip_code ( integer).
  - [x] The loans table should have the following columns: id (integer), book_id (integer), patron_id (integer), loaned_on (date), return_by (date) and returned_on (date).

### Home Screen
- [ ] As a librarian, I should have a home screen so I can access functionality easily with a single click. See home.html for an example. The home screen should include links to all of the following pages:
  - Books:
    - [ ] New Book
    - [ ] List All
    - [ ] List Overdue
    - [ ] List Checked Out
  - Patrons:
    - [ ] New Patron
    - [ ] List All
  - Loans:
    - [ ] New Loan
    - [ ] List All
    - [ ] List Overdue
    - [ ] List Checked Out
NOTE: You should use Pug to render your views for this project. Avoid using a front end framework such as Angular.js.

### Navigation
- [ ] As a librarian, I should be able to access a main navigation menu from every page of my application. The navigation should include links to the Books Listing page (all_books.html), Patrons Listing page (all_patrons.html) and Loans Listing page (all_loans.html) so I can view this information. See navigation on all pages for examples.

### Books Listing Page
